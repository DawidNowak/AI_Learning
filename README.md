# AI Learning Playground

This repository is my personal AI playground. It contains simple Python scripts where I experiment and learn about generative AI, large language models, and related technologies.

## Purpose

The goal is to explore, practice, and build a deeper understanding of AI through hands-on coding and experimentation.
